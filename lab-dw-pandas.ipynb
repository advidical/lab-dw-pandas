    "- Customer Lifetime Value - Customer lifetime value(CLV) is the total revenue the client will derive from their entire relationship with a customer. In other words, is the predicted or calculated value of a customer over their entire duration as a policyholder with the insurance company. It is an estimation of the net profit that the insurance company expects to generate from a customer throughout their relationship with the company. Customer Lifetime Value takes into account factors such as the duration of the customer's policy, premium payments, claim history, renewal likelihood, and potential additional services or products the customer may purchase. It helps insurers assess the long-term profitability and value associated with retaining a particular customer.\n",

    "### Data Descripiton + summary statistics:\n",
    "  **Categorical:**\n",
    "  - Policy type :  special auto, corporate auto, personal auto\n",
    "    - according to the data, most clients have the personal auto plan, followed by corporate then special plans; seems to indicate most of their clients are not in a corporate offiece or relatively wealthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Education : High School/below, College, Bachelor, Master, Doctor (note: duplicate in Bachelors)\n",
    "    - According to the data, it seems majority of clients went to college, although many didn't finish, some only have high school or below education, and only a few clients have advanced degrees. This could indicate that the insurance company mainly serves those with only a high school or undergraduate college education, working/middle class income workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Vehicle Class: Four-Door Car, Two-Door Car, SUV, Luxury SUV ,Sports Car, Luxury Car\n",
    "    - Most policy holders have 4 door cars, with two door cars and SUVs taking the next portion, and luxury classes are last. This indicates that most clients don't own luxurious car vehicles and only some have access to SUVs for carrying  4+ passangers and plenty of cargo space.\n",
    "  - Gender: Female, Male\n",
    "    - Female 502 (52.62%) ; Male 452 (47.38%): indicates a slight lean towards Women clients. Could maybe explain some income discrepancies; women tend to make less income on avg and some stay home to take care of kids full-time as mothers, which could explain some zero income policy holders.\n",
    "  - States: Washington Arizona Nevada California Oregon\n",
    "    - 1st California 331 ; 2nd Oregon 320 ; 3rd Arizona 211; 4th Washington 111 5th Nevada 98 ; Seems to indicate car insurande mainly serves **South/North Western USA,** particularly in Cali and Oregon. Could indicate current market reach in insurance company.\n",

    "**Insights**:\n",
    "This car insurance company seems to provide policies for working/middle class clients, corporations/corporate clients, and wealthier clients. It seems they contain a slight majority of women, most are working class, most have 4 door/ 2 door cars, most have personal auto plans, clientale is based in Western USA, and that most have at least some college education or high school education.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numerical:**\n",
    " - Income: \\$0 - \\$99960.0: indicates that they accept a broad level of income level people, even those with no recorded income; however this could be explained by couple of things, like teens who get their car insurance paid for by their parents, or corporate offices not disclosing the income of their employees. However, it does seem that they don't not have any clients with 6 or more figure salaries.\n",

    "    - *Stat Conclusion*: The mean income is ~40k, indicating the average client is in the lower income class, the median being slightly lower indicates a slight skew of higher paying clientele, and the std indicates a seemingly very wide spread of incomes at around ~30k. This indicates that they have a majority of low income clients with a few relatively more wealthy clients.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Monthly payment: \\$61 - \\$35354 - indicates a broad range of monthly premiums, could be that they have a couple of high risk clients with majorly increased premiums\n",

    "    - median: 83.0\n",
    "    - std: 1601.2\n",
    "    - *Stat Conclusion*: The mean premium is ~\\$193, indicating that the average client pays a decently high monthly premium; the median being significantly lower indicates a major skew of higher premiums, caused probably by wealthier clients or high risk clients, and the std indicates a seemingly very wide spread of premiums at around ~1.6k. This indicates that they have a majority of low income clients with a few relatively more wealthy/higher-risk clients.\n",

    "    - std: 293.02\n",
    "    - *Stat Conclusion*: The mean premium is ~\\$404, indicating that the average client gets a small claim from the insurance company; the median being slightly lower indicates a minor skew of higher premiums. The std at 293.02 is smaller than the mean, which may indicate a narrow range of claims made.

A percentile is a measure that tells us what percentage of values in a dataset are below a certain value. For example, the 75th percentile represents the value below which 75% of the data falls. Similarly, the 25th percentile represents the value below which 25% of the data falls. When we talk about the top 25%, we are referring to the values that fall above the 75th percentile, which represent the top quarter of the data. On the other hand, when we talk about the bottom 25%, we are referring to the values that fall below the 25th percentile, which represent the bottom quarter of the data. By focusing on these groups, we can identify patterns and trends that may be useful for making decisions and taking action.*\n",
